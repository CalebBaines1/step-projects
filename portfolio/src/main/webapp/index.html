          <p>
            I worked in a team to create an a.i. psychologist app using Google DialogFlow. 
            Using the natural language processing of DialogFlow we formatted conversations to assess the well-being of users and suggest ways to improve their mental health.
            I functioned as both project manager and software engineer on the team to design how the app would interact with users and I integrated the app with Facebook Messenger.
