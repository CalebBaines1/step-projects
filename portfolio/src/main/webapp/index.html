            Hello, my name is Caleb Baines. I am from Flint, Michigan.
            I am passionate in enigneering and I enjoy reading as well as playing sports.
            I have been involved in many projects and internships developing both hardware and software.
            This website will help you learn a little bit more about me.

        <p class="text-block">
            I worked in a team to create an a.i. psychologist app using Google DialogFlow. 
            Using the natural language processing of DialogFlow we formatted conversations to assess the well-being of users and suggest ways to improve their mental health.
            I functioned as both project manager and software engineer on the team to design how the app would interact with users and I integrated the app with Facebook Messenger.

        <h3 class="heading-block">Google: Engineering Practicum Intern (May 2019-August 2019)</h3>
        <p class="text-block">
            I worked on Google Flights to create a sampling pipeline for test data.
            Throughout the internship, I learned to build Google-scale pipelines, apply theoretical sampling strategy manipulation, and parse data.
            The pipeline was built using C++ and Python.
            I also had the opportunity to speak on a panel to students about Google.
